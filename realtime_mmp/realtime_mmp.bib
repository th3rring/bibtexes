   annotate = {Decomposes TAMP problem and solves in real time  based on world's state through execution. Represents actions in world as operation and modifications to world state as fluents. Decomposes operations into weakest precondition subgoals and solves those recursively. This makes order of execution critical! Will only find a plan if the goal state is reachable through some set of operations. Defines goals as conjunctions of fluents (i.e. like Clean(a)).}
