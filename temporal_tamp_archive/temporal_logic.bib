  abstract  = {In this paper, the problem of synthesizing a hybrid controller for a specification expressed as a temporal logic formula $\phi$ is considered. We propose a hierarchical approach which consists of three steps. First, the plant to be controlled is abstracted to a fully actuated system. Using the notion of approximate simulation relation, we design a continuous interface allowing the plant to track the trajectories of its abstraction with a guaranteed precision $\delta$. The second step, which is also the main contribution of this paper, consists in deriving a more robust specification $\phi${\textasciiacutex} from the temporal logic formula $\phi$ such that given a trajectory satisfying $\phi${\textasciiacutex}, any other trajectory remaining within distance $\delta$ satisfies $\phi$. Third, we design a hybrid controller for the abstraction such that all its trajectories satisfy the robust specification $\phi${\textasciiacutex}. Then, the trajectories of the plant satisfy the original specification. An application to the control of a second order model of a planar robot in a polygonal environment is considered.},

  abstract = {Robot control for tasks such as moving around obstacles or grasping objects has advanced significantly in the last few decades. However, controlling robots to perform complex tasks is still accomplished largely by highly trained programmers in a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process that is typically validated only through extensive testing. Formal methods are mathematical techniques for reasoning about systems, their requirements, and their guarantees. Formal synthesis for robotics refers to frameworks for specifying tasks in a mathematically precise language and automatically transforming these specifications into correct-by-construction robot controllers or into a proof that the task cannot be done. Synthesis allows users to reason about the task specification rather than its implementation, reduces implementation error, and provides behavioral guarantees for the resulting controller. This article reviews the current state of formal synthesis for robotics and surveys the landscape of abstractions, specifications, and synthesis algorithms that enable it.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the temporal logic motion planning problem for mobile robots that are modeled by second order dynamics. Temporal logic specifications can capture the usual control specifications such as reachability and invariance as well as more complex specifications like sequencing and obstacle avoidance. Our approach consists of three basic steps. First, we design a control law that enables the dynamic model to track a simpler kinematic model with a globally bounded error. Second, we built a robust temporal logic specification that takes into account the tracking errors of the first step. Finally, we solve the new robust temporal logic path planning problem for the kinematic model using automata theory and simple local vector fields. The resulting continuous time trajectory is provably guaranteed to satisfy the initial user specification.},
