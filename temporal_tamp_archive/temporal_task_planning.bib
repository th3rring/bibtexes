Unfortunately, this misses a large class of planning problems where it is important to consider a wider variety of temporal and non-temporal preferences, making makespan lower-order concern. In this paper we consider modeling and reasoning with plan quality metrics that are not directly correlated with plan makespan, building on the planner POPF. We begin with the preferences defined in PDDL3, and present a mixed integer programming encoding to manage the the interaction between the hard temporal constraints for plan steps, and soft temporal constraints for preferences. To widen the support of metrics that can be expressed directly in PDDL, we then discuss an extension to soft-deadlines with continuous cost functions, avoiding the need to approximate these with several PDDL3 discrete-cost preferences. We demonstrate the success of our new planner on the benchmark temporal planning problems with preferences, showing that it is the state-of-the-art for such problems. We then analyze the benefits of reasoning with continuous (versus discretized) models of domains with continuous cost functions, showing the improvement in solution quality afforded through making the continuous cost function directly available to the planner. &lt;/p&gt;},

Previously proposed approaches for temporal and hybrid planning are based on &lt;em&gt;static&lt;/em&gt; translations, in the sense that the resulting model checking problems are uniquely defined by the given input planning problems. As a drawback, the translations can become too large to be efficiently solvable. In this paper, we address propositional temporal planning, lifting static translations to a more flexible framework. Our framework is based on a refinement cycle that allows for adaptively computing suitable translations of increasing size. Our experiments on temporal IPC domains show that the resulting translations to timed automata often become succinct, resulting in promising performance when applied with the directed model checker MCTA.&lt;/p&gt;},

Hybrid domain models capture a more accurate representation of real world problems that involve continuous processes than is possible using discrete systems. However, solving problems represented as PDDL+ domains is very challenging due to the construction of complex system dynamics, including non-linear processes and events. In this paper we introduce DiNo, a new planner capable of tackling complex problems with non-linear system dynamics governing the continuous evolution of states. DiNo is based on the discretise-and-validate approach and uses the novel Staged Relaxed Planning Graph+ (SRPG+) heuristic, which is introduced in this paper. Although several planners have been developed to work with subsets of PDDL+ features, or restricted forms of processes, DiNo is currently the only heuristic planner capable of handling non-linear system dynamics combined with the full PDDL+ feature set.},

However, both of these systems (including both versions of TPSys) exploit the graph to represent a uniform flow of time. In this paper we describe an alternative approach, in which the graph is used to represent the purely logical structuring of the plan, with temporal constraints being managed separately (although not independently). The approach uses a linear constraint solver to ensure that temporal durations are correctly respected. The resulting planner offers an interesting alternative to the other approaches, offering an important extension in expressive power.},

In this paper we explore the potential of a forward-chaining state-based search strategy to support partial-order planning in the solution of temporal-numeric problems. Our planner, POPF, is built on the foundations of grounded forward search, in combination with linear programming to handle continuous linear numeric change. To achieve a partial ordering we delay commitment to ordering decisions, timestamps and the values of numeric parameters, managing sets of constraints as actions are started and ended. In the context of a partially ordered collection of actions, constructing the linear program is complicated and we propose an efficient method for achieving this. Our late-commitment approach achieves flexibility, while benefiting from the informative search control of forward planning, and allows temporal and metric decisions to be made - as is most efficient - by the LP solver rather than by the discrete reasoning of the planner. We compare POPF with the approach of constructing a sequenced plan and then lifting a partial order from it, showing that our approach can offer improvements in terms of makespan, and time to find a solution, in several benchmark domains. &lt;/p&gt;},

Stochastic modelling has been concerned with verification of system performance metrics for some time: given a model of a system, determining whether it will meet a service-level agreement (SLA). For example, whether a given sequence of transitions on a network will complete within 5 seconds 80% of the time. The problem of deciding how to reconfigure the system most cost-effectively when the SLA cannot be met has not been widely explored: it is currently solved manually. Inspired by this, we consider how planning can be used to automate the configuration of service-oriented systems. Configuring these stochastic systems presents new challenges to planning: building plans that meet SLAs, but also have low cost. To this end, we present a domain-independent planner for planning problems with action costs and stochastic durations, and show how this can be used to solve both traditional planning domains, and within the framework of configuring a larger process algebra model.},

Through this work we make two advances to the state-of-the-art in terms of expressive reasoning capabilities of planners: the handling of continuous linear change, and the handling of duration-dependent effects in combination with duration inequalities, both of which require tightly coupled temporal and numeric reasoning during planning. COLIN combines FF-style forward chaining search, with the use of a Linear Program (LP) to check the consistency of the interacting temporal and numeric constraints at each state. The LP is used to compute bounds on the values of variables in each state, reducing the range of actions that need to be considered for application. In addition, we develop an extension of the Temporal Relaxed Planning Graph heuristic of CRIKEY3, to support reasoning directly with continuous change. We extend the range of task variables considered to be suitable candidates for specifying the gradient of the continuous numeric change effected by an action. Finally, we explore the potential for employing mixed integer programming as a tool for optimising the timestamps of the actions in the plan, once a solution has been found. To support this, we further contribute a selection of extended benchmark domains that include continuous numeric effects. We present results for COLIN that demonstrate its scalability on a range of benchmarks, and compare to existing state-of-the-art planners.},

Despite its great industrial importance, the LSFRP has received little attention in the literature. We show how the LSFRP can be solved sub-optimally using the planner POPF and optimally with a mixed-integer program (MIP) and a novel method called Temporal Optimization Planning (TOP).
