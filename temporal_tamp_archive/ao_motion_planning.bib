  abstract    = {We present a motion planner for planning through space-time with dynamic obstacles, velocity constraints, and unknown arrival time. Our algorithm, Space-Time RRT* (ST-RRT*), is a probabilistically complete, bidirectional motion planning algorithm, which is asymptotically optimal with respect to the shortest arrival time. We experimentally evaluate ST-RRT* in both abstract (2D disk, 8D disk in cluttered spaces, and on a narrow passage problem), and simulated robotic path planning problems (sequential planning of 8DoF mobile robots, and 7DoF robotic arms). The proposed planner outperforms RRT-Connect and RRT* on both initial solution time, and attained final solution cost. The code for ST-RRT* is available in the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL).},

  abstract = {Motion planning is a fundamental problem in autonomous robotics that requires finding a path to a specified goal that avoids obstacles and takes into account a robot's limitations and constraints. It is often desirable for this path to also optimize a cost function, such as path length. Formal path-quality guarantees for continuously valued search spaces are an active area of research interest. Recent results have proven that some sampling-based planning methods probabilistically converge toward the optimal solution as computational effort approaches infinity. This article summarizes the assumptions behind these popular asymptotically optimal techniques and provides an introduction to the significant ongoing research on this topic.},
