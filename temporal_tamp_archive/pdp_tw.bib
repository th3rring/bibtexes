  abstract  = {The pickup and delivery problem with time windows is the problem of serving a number of transportation requests using a limited amount of vehicles. Each request involves moving a number of goods from a pickup location to a delivery location. Our task is to construct routes that visit all locations such that corresponding pickups and deliveries are placed on the same route, and such that a pickup is performed before the corresponding delivery. The routes must also satisfy time window and capacity constraints. This paper presents a heuristic for the problem based on an extension of the large neighborhood search heuristic previously suggested for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The proposed heuristic is composed of a number of competing subheuristics that are used with a frequency corresponding to their historic performance. This general framework is denoted adaptive large neighborhood search. The heuristic is tested on more than 350 benchmark instances with up to 500 requests. It is able to improve the best known solutions from the literature for more than 50% of the problems. The computational experiments indicate that it is advantageous to use several competing subheuristics instead of just one. We believe that the proposed heuristic is very robust and is able to adapt to various instance characteristics.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW), capacitated vehicles must be routed to satisfy a set of transportation requests between given origins and destinations. In addition to capacity and time window constraints, vehicle routes must also satisfy pairing and precedence constraints on pickups and deliveries. This paper introduces two new formulations for the PDPTW and the closely related dial-a-ride problem (DARP) in which a limit is imposed on the elapsed time between the pickup and the delivery of a request. Several families of valid inequalities are introduced to strengthen these two formulations. These inequalities are used within branch-and-cut algorithms which have been tested on several instance sets for both the PDPTW and the DARP. Instances with up to eight vehicles and 96 requests (194 nodes) have been solved to optimality. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, Vol. 49(4), 258–272 2007},

  abstract = {The vehicle routing problem (vrp) involves the design of a set of minimum cost routes for a fleet of vehicles which services exactly once a set of customers with known demands. The pickup and delivery problem with time windows (pdptw) is a generalization of the vrp which is concerned with the construction of optimal routes to satisfy transportation requests, each requiring both pickup and delivery under capacity, time window and precedence constraints. This paper presents an exact algorithm which solves the pickup and delivery problem when transporting goods. This algorithm uses a column generation scheme with a constrained shortest path as a subproblem. The algorithm can handle multiple depots and different types of vehicles.},
