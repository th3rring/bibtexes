  abstract  = {Planning with hybrid domains modelled in PDDL+ has been gaining research interest in the Automated Planning community in recent years. Hybrid domain models capture a more accurate representation of real world problems that involve continuous processes than is possible using discrete systems. However, solving problems represented as PDDL+ domains is very challenging due to the construction of complex system dynamics, including non-linear processes and events. In this paper we introduce DiNo, a new planner capable of tackling complex problems with non-linear system dynamics governing the continuous evolution of states. DiNo is based on the discretise-and-validate approach and uses the novel Staged Relaxed Planning Graph+ (SRPG+) heuristic, which is introduced in this paper. Although several planners have been developed to work with subsets of PDDL+ features, or restricted forms of processes, DiNo is currently the only heuristic planner capable of handling non-linear system dynamics combined with the full PDDL+ feature set.},

We begin with the preferences defined in PDDL3, and present a mixed integer programming encoding to manage the the interaction between the hard temporal constraints for plan steps, and soft temporal constraints for preferences. To widen the support of metrics that can be expressed directly in PDDL, we then discuss an extension to soft-deadlines with continuous cost functions, avoiding the need to approximate these with several PDDL3 discrete-cost preferences. We demonstrate the success of our new planner on the benchmark temporal planning problems with preferences, showing that it is the state-of-the-art for such problems. We then analyze the benefits of reasoning with continuous (versus discretized) models of domains with continuous cost functions, showing the improvement in solution quality afforded through making the continuous cost function directly available to the planner. &lt;/p&gt; },

Previously proposed approaches for temporal and hybrid planning are based on &lt;em&gt;static&lt;/em&gt; translations, in the sense that the resulting model checking problems are uniquely defined by the given input planning problems. As a drawback, the translations can become too large to be efficiently solvable. In this paper, we address propositional temporal planning, lifting static translations to a more flexible framework. Our framework is based on a refinement cycle that allows for adaptively computing suitable translations of increasing size. Our experiments on temporal IPC domains show that the resulting translations to timed automata often become succinct, resulting in promising performance when applied with the directed model checker MCTA.&lt;/p&gt;},

But acting requires &lt;em&gt;operational models&lt;/em&gt; that describe &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do things, with rich control structures for closed-loop online decision-making. Using descriptive representations for planning and operational representations for acting can lead to problems with developing and verifying consistency of the different models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We define and implement an integrated acting-and-planning system in which both planning and acting use the same operational models, which are written in a general-purpose hierarchical task-oriented language offering rich control structures. The acting component is inspired by the well-known PRS system, except that instead of being purely reactive, it can get advice from the planner. Our planning algorithm, RAEplan, plans by doing Monte Carlo rollout simulations of the actor’s operational models. Our experiments show significant benefits in the efficiency of the acting and planning system.&lt;/p&gt;},
